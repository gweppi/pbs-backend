# PBs - Backend

PBs stands for Personal Bests. This repo contains the backend for the [iOS app](https://github.com/gweppi/pbs-ios) I have also built.
The app shows what you would normally see on [swimrankings](https://www.swimrankings.net) when you searched for your best set records - but more user-friendly.

You can spin up your own instance by pulling the image from DockerHub: `docker pull gweppi/pbs:latest`.
